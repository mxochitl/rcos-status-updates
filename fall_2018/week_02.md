## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I have been working with the curriculum and framework group to get them up to speed with using Git, React, and the Flask framework

## This Week's Plan

> Get everyone started on making a mini React app to see what they can do with it/ what we can incoorporate into curriculum

## Anything Blocking?

> N/A

## Notes

>  Everyone is at much different levels so I will have to make sure everyone has something to do and no one is left behind
