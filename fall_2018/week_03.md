## Last Week's Accomplishments

> We have broken down who will be working on learning Frameworks VS specific languages for curriculum dev.

## This Week's Plan

> We started looking at which tutorials we are going to start with. We have decided that we are going to build tutorials for smaller games that will eventually lead into something much bigger. For example, we will create exercises that guide our students through the creation of tic-tac-toe that will eventually lead into a more complex game like ConnectFour. 

## Anything Blocking?

> It is hard to keep everyone organized and ensure that they have a specific task with so many people at varying levels of knowledge.
